<p>Hello World! I am Rahul Thakoor. I have always been very passionate about technology. I somehow ended up in medical school after high school. During those years, I also self-taught myself some programming and hardware skills. After completing my medical degree, I decided to study computer science.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of open source projects. I have learnt a lot by tinkering with Arduino boards.
I am always looking for new challenges. I enjoy reading a lot and show a keen interest in eHealth/mHealth, Data Science, Web development, etc </p>
