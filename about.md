<p>Hello World! I am Rahul Thakoor. I have always been very passionate about technology. Despite being in medical school, I self-taught myself some programming and hardware skills. After completing my medical degree, I decided to study computer science.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of open source projects. I have learnt a lot by tinkering with Arduino boards.
I am always looking for new challenges and have too many interests to be listed here.</p>
