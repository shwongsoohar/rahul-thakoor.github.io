<p>The Developers Conference, organised by the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/MauritiusSoftwareCraftsmanshipCommunity/" target="_blank">MSCC</a>, is the BIGGEST tech event in Mauritius. DevCon brought together tech enthusiasts, hobbyists, numerous user groups, prestigious companies, students, and more!!! I was privileged to present as a Microsoft Student Partner.</p>

<h2 id="the-session">The Session</h2>
<p>I chose to present on <strong>NodeBots: Using Javascript for hardware programming</strong>. I was soon joined by MSP @dishaykissoon. 
The idea was to use NodeBots and Javascript as an entry point to get more people interested in hardware programming and DIY projects.</p>

<p>Here are a few things we covered during the session:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Giving a few examples of hardware programming and IoT</li>
  <li>Introducing a few development boards such as the Arduino, Intel Edison and Esp8266.</li>
  <li>Why use Javascript instead of traditional Arduino IDE, C/C++?</li>
  <li>The Johnny-five framework</li>
  <li>How NodeBots work?</li>
  <li>A few Demos</li>
  <li>What’s Next?</li>
</ol>

<p>I was amazed by the response we recieved from the audience. Also, I was convinced that many Mauritians are interested in hardware programming and we need to eliminate the barriers that exist.</p>

<p>As I was making the case for promoting the Maker Culture in Mauritius, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yovan/" target="_blank">Yovan Fowdar</a> seized the opportunity to reach out to the crowd and promote the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/mauritiusmakers/" target="_blank">Mauritius Maker Community</a>. Indeed, I believe different communities in Mauritius should team up to get more people interested in tech, electronics, open source projects, etc.</p>

<p>It was the first time I presented at DevCon. Presenting at DevCon <strong>IS</strong> scary, however the experience is worthwhile. I am grateful for @dishaykissoon and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MSPartnersMauritius/" target="_blank">Microsoft Student Partners Mauritius</a> for making the presentation a reality.</p>

<p>Preparation is vital. Before the session, we had a lot of dry runs. However, on the day of the session, I was reminded of Sod’s Law! I read about it in medical school but experienced during devcon. Sod’s Law states that if something can go wrong it will! and at the worst possible time!!! Just before the session, libraries were deprecated, servers were not working properly, the wiring were somehow faulty… While we were stressed beyond limits, we managed to get everything working in time. We had to think on our feet and improvise.</p>
