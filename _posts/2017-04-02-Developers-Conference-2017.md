The Developers Conference, organised by the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/MauritiusSoftwareCraftsmanshipCommunity/" target="_blank">MSCC</a>, is the __BIGGEST__ tech event in Mauritius. DevCon brought together tech enthusiasts, hobbyists, numerous user groups, prestigious companies, students, and more!!! I was privileged to present as a Microsoft Student Partner.

My team(@dishaykissoon and me), presented on __NodeBots: Using Javascript for hardware programming__. The idea was to use NodeBots and Javascript as an entry point to get more people interested in hardware programming and DIY projects. 

Here are a few things we covered during the session:
1. Giving a few examples of hardware programming and IoT
2. Introducing a few development boards such as the Arduino, Intel Edison and Esp8266.
3. Why use Javascript instead of traditional Arduino IDE, C/C++?
4. The Johnny-five framework
5. How NodeBots work?
6. A few Demos
7. What's Next?

As I was making the case for promoting the maker culture in Mauritius, <a href ="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yovan/" target="_blank">Yovan Fowdar</a> seized the opportunity to reach out to the crowd and promote the <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/groups/mauritiusmakers/" target="_blank">Mauritius Maker Community</a>. Indeed, I believe different communities in Mauritius should team up to get more people interested in tech, electronics, open source projects, etc.

I was amazed by the response we recieved from the audience. Also, I was convinced that many Mauritians are interested in hardware programming and we need to eliminate the barriers that exist.

After the presentation, I had a very interesting conversation with Yovan Fowdar and @NadeemDookhan. We discussed the need for reaching out into the community and inspire more people, whether from a technical background or not, to get started with hardware programming.

It was the first time I presented at DevCon. Presenting at DevCon __IS__ scary, however the experience is worthwhile. I am grateful for @dishaykissoon, the <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/MSPartnersMauritius/" target="_blank">Microsoft Student Partners Mauritius</a> and all my friends and family for making the presentation a reality.

DevCon 2017 proved to be huge success. This is undeniably due to the hard work of the organising team, especially @JKirstaetter and the MSCC, and all the sponsors and volunteers. I am already looking forward for the next Developers Conference!
